# decisionLog.md

This file logs important decisions made during the project, including context, options considered, and rationale.

## Decisions Made

### 1. Python Environment Management
* **Context:** Setting up Python environment for the project.
* **Options Considered:** Poetry, virtualenv, conda.
* **Decision:** virtualenv with Python 3.9.x due to initial Poetry setup failure and better compatibility.
* **Rationale:** virtualenv is a reliable and simpler option for this project setup phase.

### 2. LLM Provider Configuration Method
* **Context:** Configuring multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Google Gemini, Claude) for Langgraph.
* **Options Considered:** CLI commands, programmatic configuration.
* **Decision:** Implemented programmatic configuration using Python script (`llm_config.py`).
* **Rationale:** CLI commands were not working properly, and programmatic configuration offers more flexibility and better error handling.
