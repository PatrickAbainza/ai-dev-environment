# Terminal Access Plan

## Overview

The terminal access plan is designed to provide secure and efficient access to the terminal for development and testing purposes.

## Implementation

*   The `rsync` command is used to sync the terminal output to the `~/writable/directory/AI_IDE` directory.
*   The `--update` option is used to ensure that only changed files are synced in real-time.

## Configuration

*   Source Directory: `/Users/patrickabainza/neo_env`
*   Destination Directory: `~/writable/directory/AI_IDE`
*   Sync Command: `rsync -avz --update /Users/patrickabainza/neo_env/new_terminal_file.txt ~/writable/directory/AI_IDE/`

## Testing

*   The sync operation has been tested and verified to work as expected.
*   The `new_terminal_file.txt` file is successfully synced to the `~/writable/directory/AI_IDE` directory.

## Implementing on Other Projects

To implement this terminal sync setup on other projects, follow these steps:

1.  **Identify Source and Destination Directories:**
    *   Determine the source directory containing the terminal output files you want to sync.
    *   Choose a suitable destination directory within your project for the synced files.
2.  **Configure `rsync` Command:**
    *   Use the `rsync` command with the `--update` option to sync only changed files.
    *   Specify the source and destination directories in the command.
3.  **Schedule the Sync Operation (Optional):**
    *   If desired, use a scheduler like `cron` to run the `rsync` command at regular intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes) to keep the destination directory up-to-date.

Example `rsync` Command for Other Projects:

```bash
rsync -avz --update /path/to/source/directory/ /path/to/destination/directory/
```

Replace `/path/to/source/directory/` and `/path/to/destination/directory/` with your actual directory paths.

**Note:** Ensure you have the necessary permissions to read from the source directory and write to the destination directory.
